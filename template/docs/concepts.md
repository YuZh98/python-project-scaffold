# Concepts

Quick reference for concepts the scaffold uses. One paragraph each; click the link for depth. Not exhaustive — see [`enforcement-model.md`](enforcement-model.md) for how these concepts compose.

---

## venv (virtual environment)

A per-project Python install with its own dependencies. `python -m venv .venv` creates one in the current directory; `source .venv/bin/activate` enters it. Without a venv, `pip install` mutates the system Python — packages collide across projects and "works on my machine" becomes unfixable.

→ [Python docs: venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## src layout

Project source code lives in `src/<your-package>/` rather than at the repo root. The advantage: tests cannot import the package by accident from the working directory — they must use the installed copy, which is exactly what end users will get. Without `src/`, a half-broken install can still pass tests.

## Type hints

Annotations on function parameters and return values that declare expected types. `def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:` says both args and the return are ints. Hints have no runtime effect by themselves; tools like `pyright` check them at lint time.

→ [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/)

## Static analysis (ruff + pyright)

Two complementary checkers that run without executing your code. `ruff` enforces formatting and lint rules (unused imports, line length, naming). `pyright basic` enforces type-hint correctness. Both run in CI; ruff also runs as a pre-commit hook with `--fix` so trivial issues are auto-corrected.

→ [ruff docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) · [pyright docs](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/)

## Pre-commit hooks

Scripts that run automatically before `git commit` finalises. The scaffold ships hooks that run ruff (lint+autofix), trim trailing whitespace, fix end-of-file newlines, and reject merge-conflict markers and malformed YAML/TOML. A failing hook blocks the commit until you fix the issue or amend.

## pytest fixtures

Reusable test setup defined with `@pytest.fixture`. A fixture function's return value is injected into any test that names it as a parameter. Fixtures replace `setUp`/`tearDown` from `unittest` and compose cleanly — small fixtures can depend on other fixtures.

→ [pytest fixtures docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html)

## Pinning tests

Tests that assert structural invariants about the code rather than functional behaviour — e.g. "no `print()` in production code", "every public function has type hints", "imports follow the layered contract". The scaffold ships five in `tests/test_rules.py` plus `tests/test_cohesion.py::TestSrcLayoutPresent`. Pinning tests catch drift that human review and ad-hoc lint rules miss.

→ This scaffold's [`tests/test_rules.py`](../tests/test_rules.py) — start there.

## Conventional Commits

A commit-message format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` where type is `feat` / `fix` / `chore` / `docs` / `test` / `refactor` / `style` / `perf`. Subject ≤ 72 chars, imperative mood ("add" not "added"). The format powers automated changelog generation and forces commit authors to declare intent.

→ [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

## ADR (Architectural Decision Record)

A short markdown document recording a hard-to-reverse architectural choice: context, decision, alternatives considered, consequences, enforcement. Write one when (a) the decision is architectural, (b) it would be expensive to undo, (c) at least one alternative was viable. The scaffold ships `docs/adr/ADR-0000-scaffold-choices.md` as a worked example you can copy.

## Keep-a-Changelog + coverage gate

`CHANGELOG.md` follows a fixed format: latest version at top, `[Unreleased]` collects in-progress work, six legal subsection headings (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed` / `Deprecated` / `Security`). Coverage gate: the CI fails if `pytest --cov` reports below 95% line coverage on the Python 3.14 matrix entry. Together they make every release auditable and force tests for new code.
